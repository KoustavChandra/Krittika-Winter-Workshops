# Krittika-Winter-Workshops
iPython notebooks for gravitational wave searches

The notebook is available to view, download, or run in interactive sessions. They are heavily based on the existing [PyCBC tutorials](https://github.com/gwastro/PyCBC-Tutorials) which I will highly recommend you to see.

Comments/criticism are welcome.
